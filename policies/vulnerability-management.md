# 1. Overview
This policy defines the requirements for a continuous vulnerability management program to identify, assess, remediate, and report on security vulnerabilities in a timely manner. The goal is to reduce the organization's attack surface and mitigate risk.

# 2. Scope
This policy applies to all company-owned or managed assets, including servers, workstations, network devices, applications, and cloud infrastructure.

# 3. Policy Statements

*   **PS-1: Asset Inventory:** A complete and accurate inventory of all assets in scope must be maintained to ensure comprehensive vulnerability scanning.
*   **PS-2: Vulnerability Scanning:** All in-scope assets must be scanned for vulnerabilities in accordance with the `vulnerability-scanning-standard.md`.
*   **PS-3: Risk Rating:** All identified vulnerabilities must be assigned a risk rating (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on a combination of exploitability, impact, and other environmental factors. The CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) shall be used as a baseline.
*   **PS-4: Remediation Timelines:** Vulnerabilities must be remediated within defined timelines based on their risk rating.
    *   **Critical:** 15 days
    *   **High:** 30 days
    *   **Medium:** 90 days
    *   **Low:** 180 days
*   **PS-5: Penetration Testing:** The organization will conduct regular penetration tests against critical systems and applications to identify vulnerabilities not discoverable by automated scanners.

# 4. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Security Engineering Team:** Responsible for managing the vulnerability management program, including operating scanning tools and tracking remediation.
*   **Asset Owners:** Responsible for ensuring that vulnerabilities identified on their assets are remediated within the defined timelines.
*   **Developers:** Responsible for remediating vulnerabilities in the code they develop.
*   **IT Operations:** Responsible for remediating vulnerabilities on infrastructure and operating systems.

# 5. Compliance

*   **Measurement:** Compliance with this policy will be measured by tracking remediation SLAs, the age of open vulnerabilities, and the results of regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests.
*   **Exceptions:** Any exception to the remediation timelines must be formally documented as a risk acceptance, including justification and mitigating controls, and approved by the CISO.
*   **Enforcement:** Consistent failure to remediate vulnerabilities within the required timelines may result in system isolation or other risk-reduction measures.

## Applicable Controls

* **ISO 27001**: A.12.6
* **SOC 2**: CC7.1
* **NIST CSF**: PR.IP-12
