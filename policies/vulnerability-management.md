# Vulnerability Management Policy

This document outlines the policy for vulnerability management. This policy defines the requirements for managing vulnerabilities in our systems and applications. The security engineering team is responsible for continuously identifying vulnerabilities through automated scanning and penetration testing. All identified vulnerabilities will be assessed and assigned a risk rating based on severity and exploitability. High and Critical-rated vulnerabilities must be remediated within 30 days of discovery, while lower-rated vulnerabilities must be addressed within 90 days.

## Applicable Controls

* **ISO 27001**: A.12.6
* **SOC 2**: CC7.1
* **NIST CSF**: PR.IP-12
