# 1. Overview
This policy establishes the framework for responding to security incidents in a coordinated and effective manner. The goal is to minimize the impact of incidents, restore normal operations as quickly as possible, and prevent future occurrences.

# 2. Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties, and it covers all security incidents involving company assets, data, or personnel. A security incident is any event that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our systems or data.

# 3. Policy Statements

*   **PS-1: Incident Response Team (IRT):** A dedicated Incident Response Team (IRT) is established and maintained with clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and authority to manage security incidents.
*   **PS-2: Incident Response Lifecycle:** The incident response process must follow the standard lifecycle: Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment, Eradication, and Recovery.
*   **PS-3: Incident Reporting:** All suspected security incidents must be reported immediately to the IRT in accordance with the `incident-reporting-process.md`.
*   **PS-4: Post-Incident Review:** All security incidents must undergo a post-incident review (post-mortem) to identify the root cause and lessons learned. The results must be used to improve security controls and processes.
*   **PS-5: Communication:** The IRT is responsible for managing all internal and external communications related to a security incident, in coordination with Legal, HR, and Corporate Communications.

# 4. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Incident Response Team (IRT):** The IRT has overall responsibility for managing the incident response lifecycle.
*   **Security Operations Center (SOC):** Responsible for initial detection, analysis, and escalation of potential incidents.
*   **Legal & HR Teams:** Provide guidance on legal, regulatory, and employee-related matters during an incident.
*   **All Employees:** Responsible for immediately reporting any suspected security incidents.

# 5. Compliance

*   **Measurement:** Compliance with this policy will be measured by tracking incident response metrics (e.g., time to detect, time to contain) and through regular tabletop exercises and simulations.
*   **Exceptions:** Any exception to this policy must be formally documented and approved by the Head of Incident Response and the CISO.
*   **Enforcement:** Failure to report a known security incident or obstructing an investigation may result in disciplinary action.

## Applicable Controls

* **ISO 27001**: A.16.1
* **SOC 2**: CC7.3
* **NIST CSF**: DE.CM-8, DE.AE-2
