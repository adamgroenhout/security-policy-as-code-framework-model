# Incident Response Policy

This document outlines the policy for incident response. This policy establishes the framework for responding to security incidents. The incident response process is structured around the following phases: Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment, Eradication, and Recovery. All security incidents must be reported immediately to the Incident Response Team. The team is responsible for managing the response process, from initial detection through post-incident review, to minimize impact and prevent future occurrences.
