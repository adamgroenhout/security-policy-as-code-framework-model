# Phishing Awareness Guidance

This document provides non-mandatory guidance to help all employees identify and avoid phishing attacks. Being vigilant is our first line of defense.

## How to Spot a Phishing Email

Look out for these common red flags:

*   **Urgent or Threatening Language:** Be suspicious of emails that demand you take immediate action or create a sense of panic (e.g., "Your account will be suspended in 24 hours!").
*   **Generic Greetings:** Legitimate companies will often address you by name. Be wary of generic greetings like "Dear Customer" or "Valued Member."
*   **Suspicious Links or Attachments:** Hover over links before you click to see the actual URL. If it looks strange, don't click it. Never open attachments from unknown senders.
*   **Poor Grammar and Spelling:** While not always present, obvious spelling and grammar mistakes are a common sign of a phishing attempt.
*   **Mismatched Sender Address:** Check if the sender's email address matches the organization they claim to be from. Look for subtle misspellings (e.g., `user@micros0ft.com`).

If you suspect an email is a phishing attempt, do not click any links, open attachments, or reply. Report it immediately following the `incident-reporting-process.md`.
