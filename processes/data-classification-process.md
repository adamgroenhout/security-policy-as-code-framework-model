# Data Classification Process

This document provides the step-by-step process for classifying data in accordance with the Data Classification Standard.

## Process Steps

1.  **Identify the Data:** Identify the new dataset or document that needs to be classified.
2.  **Identify the Data Owner:** Assign a data owner who will be responsible for the data's lifecycle.
3.  **Analyze Data Content:** Review the content of the data to identify any sensitive information (e.g., PII, financial data, company secrets).
4.  **Consult the Standard:** Refer to the `data-classification-standard.md` to determine the appropriate classification level (Public, Internal, Confidential, or Restricted) based on the data's sensitivity.
5.  **Apply Classification Label:** Apply the chosen classification as metadata to the data or system where it resides (e.g., as a database column tag, a document header, etc.).
6.  **Document the Decision:** Record the classification decision in the team's data inventory or asset management system.
