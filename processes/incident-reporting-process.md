# 1. Overview
This document provides the step-by-step process for all employees and contractors to report a suspected security incident. Timely and accurate reporting is critical for an effective incident response.

# 2. Prerequisites
*   The individual reporting the incident should have access to at least one of the communication channels listed below (phone, email, or Slack).

# 3. Process Steps

1.  **Discover a Potential Incident:** The process begins when an employee or system discovers a potential security incident.
    *   *Examples:* Receiving a suspicious email, noticing unusual activity on a laptop, seeing an alert from a security tool, losing a company device.
2.  **Choose Reporting Channel:** Select the appropriate channel based on urgency.
    *   **High Urgency (Active threat, system compromise in progress):**
        *   *Action:* Immediately call the 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) hotline at x12345.
    *   **Medium/Low Urgency (Suspicious email, non-critical issue):**
        *   *Action:* Email the Incident Response Team at `incident.response@example.com` OR post in the `#security-incidents` Slack channel. For suspicious emails, use the "Report Phishing" button in the email client.
3.  **Provide Key Information:** When making the report, provide as much detail as possible. Do not include sensitive data in the initial report (especially in Slack).
    *   *Required Information:*
        *   Your name and contact information.
        *   A clear description of the suspected incident.
        *   Date and time the event was observed.
        *   Any systems, data, or users known to be affected.
        *   (For email reports) Forward the suspicious email as an attachment.
4.  **Preserve Evidence:**
    *   *Action:* Do not turn off, restart, or alter the state of an affected system. Do not delete suspicious emails or log files. Await instructions from the Incident Response Team (IRT).
5.  **Await Instruction:** The IRT will acknowledge your report and provide further instructions.
    *   *Action:* Follow all instructions provided by the IRT. Do not discuss the incident with anyone outside of the response team.

# 4. Expected Outcomes
*   The Incident Response Team receives a timely and accurate report of a potential security incident.
*   The reporter receives a confirmation that their report has been received.
*   Critical evidence is preserved for investigation.
*   The formal incident response lifecycle is initiated.
