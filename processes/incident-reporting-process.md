# Incident Reporting Process

This document provides the step-by-step process for reporting a suspected security incident, in accordance with the Incident Response Policy. Timely reporting is critical to minimizing the impact of an incident.

## Process Steps

1.  **Identify a Suspected Incident:** An incident could be anything from a suspected phishing email, a lost or stolen laptop, to unusual system behavior. If you see something suspicious, report it.
2.  **Immediately Contact the Incident Response Team:**
    *   **High Urgency (active threat):** Call the 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) hotline at x12345.
    *   **Medium/Low Urgency:** Email the Incident Response Team at `incident.response@example.com` or report via the #security-incidents Slack channel.
3.  **Provide Key Information:** When reporting, provide as much of the following information as possible:
    *   Your name and contact information.
    *   A description of the suspected incident.
    *   The date and time you observed the incident.
    *   The systems, data, or users that are affected.
    *   Any error messages or logs you have.
4.  **Preserve Evidence:** Do not turn off or tamper with the affected system. Do not delete suspicious emails. Await instructions from the Incident Response Team.
5.  **Follow Instructions:** The Incident Response Team will take over the incident and provide you with instructions.
