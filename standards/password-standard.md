# Password Standard

This standard supports the Access Control Policy by defining the minimum requirements for all user and system account passwords.

## Password Requirements

All user-facing passwords must meet the following criteria:
*   **Minimum Length:** 14 characters
*   **Complexity:** Must contain characters from at least three of the following four categories:
    *   Uppercase letters (A-Z)
    *   Lowercase letters (a-z)
    *   Numbers (0-9)
    *   Special characters (`~!@#$%^&*_-+=`|\\(){}[]:;"'<>,.?/`)
*   **History:** Users may not reuse any of their last 5 passwords.
*   **Expiration:** Passwords must be changed at least every 90 days.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be enabled on all accounts where it is available.
