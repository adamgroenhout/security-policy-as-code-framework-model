# Data Classification Standard

This standard operationalizes the Data Security Policy by defining the official data classification levels and the handling requirements for each. All data owners are responsible for ensuring their data is classified correctly.

## Classification Levels

*   **Restricted:** Data with the highest sensitivity. Unauthorized disclosure could cause catastrophic harm to the business or its customers (e.g., customer financial data, authentication secrets). Requires the strongest security controls.
*   **Confidential:** Sensitive data intended for internal use only by a limited, authorized audience. Unauthorized disclosure could have a significant negative impact (e.g., business strategy documents, employee PII).
*   **Internal:** Data intended for all internal employees but not for public disclosure (e.g., internal wikis, general team communications).
*   **Public:** Data that is approved for public release (e.g., marketing materials, public website content).
