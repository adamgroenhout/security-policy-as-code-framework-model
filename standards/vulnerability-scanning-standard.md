# Vulnerability Scanning Standard

This standard supports the Vulnerability Management Policy by defining the mandatory requirements for vulnerability scanning across the organization's assets.

## Scanning Requirements

*   **Scope:** All production systems, applications, and network devices must be included in the scope of vulnerability scanning.
*   **Frequency:**
    *   External-facing systems must be scanned at least once per month.
    *   Internal systems must be scanned at least once per quarter.
    *   Authenticated scans must be used wherever technically feasible to ensure deep inspection.
*   **Tooling:** All scanning must be performed using the security team's approved vulnerability scanning platform.
*   **Reporting:** Scan results must be automatically ingested into the central vulnerability management platform for tracking and remediation assignment.
